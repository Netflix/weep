## weep serve

Run a local ECS Credential Provider endpoint that serves and caches credentials for roles on demand

### Synopsis

The serve command runs a local webserver that serves the /ecs/ path. When the
AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI environment variable is set to a URL, the 
AWS CLI and SDKs will use that URL to retrieve credentials. For example, if 
you want to use credentials for a role called SuperCoolRole, you could do 
something like this:

AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI=http://localhost:9091/ecs/SuperCoolRole \
        aws sts get-caller-identity

If you just want to use a single role, use the 'role' positional argument to specify which one and it
will be served the same way credentials are served in an EC2 instance. Thereâ€™s no need
to set an environment variable for this.
